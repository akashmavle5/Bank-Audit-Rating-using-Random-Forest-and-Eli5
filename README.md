# Bank-Audit-Rating-using-Random-Forest-and-Eli5
Learning a Financial Institution's decision making approach

**If you are looking to skim over the project without going into too much detail, you can always access it through [_here_](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mick-zhang/Bank-Audit-Rating-using-Random-Forest-and-Eli5/blob/master/Bank%20Audit%20Rating%20Github.ipynb).**

The Canadian banking system continues to thrive despite constant changes in financial innovations and technological integrations. As a result, Banks and Financial Institutions are constantly being audited in order to satisfy the OSFI's (Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions) stringent rules and regulations of. However, as long as an audits involves Human interactions, then this creates an opportunity for Human errors. For example, if a program is 100% accurate, Humans would still disagree 20% of the time. The reason for this is that Humans can make bias errors and opinion errors from our decision making process, while on the other hand, computers do not make the same bias errors and opinion errors, but instead make different errors which is not comparable to Human errors (ie. understanding jokes, sarcasm, etc).
I will be attempting to create an "Internal Audit System" in avoiding errors that an Auditor can potentially make 20% of the time. 

The dataset I will be using is directly from a Canadian Bank, and I will not be able to share this dataset. For privacy protection, I will not showcase any relevant information from the actual dataset for privacy protection. Any information shown here will not violate the privacy of the Bank.

This project was completed using Jupyter Notebook and Python with Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn and Eli5.

I was able to dive into real world data and apply it in a business context. I will continue to upload interesting topics in the future to enhance a Financial Institution's capabilities using Machine Learning and Deep Learning!
